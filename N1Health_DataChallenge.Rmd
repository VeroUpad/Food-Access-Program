# Overview
Food retailers produce considerable food waste in the US due to factors like overstocking, consumer demand, and expiration dates ([Food Waste Feast](https://foodwastefeast.com/why-we-waste-ugly-food-expiration-dates-and-more)). I propose deploying food access programs that redistribute surplus produce from nearby *potential* Food Donors (grocery stores, convenience stores, and farmers markets) to nearby food insecure communities. While many major retailers already contribute to food banks and pantries, this initiative expands the effort by incorporating farmers markets, ensuring that cosmetically imperfect but nutritious produce from all potential donors are not wasted.

# Investigation 
A program combining Food Banks and Mobile Food Banks can be effective way to redistribute surplus foods. Surplus produce and foods from Food Donors (grocery stores, convenience stores, and farmers markets) can be donated to a Food Bank, then a Mobile Food Bank can travel to and set-up in a food insecure sub-cluster for a full work- day and distribute this surplus foods.

## Broad Examination: US Map of Food Insecurity

To identify the states with high priority needs for a food access program, I designed a choropleth map visualizing the most food- insecure states in the country by *averaging the food insecurity rates within each state. 

According to the map, New York, Minnesota, and Louisiana are among the top most food insecure states in the country. It is sensible to prioritize implementing the most number food access programs in those three states first. 

**Data Flaw:-** Six states did not have metrics on food insecurity. Considering California's significant population, for instance, it may be useful to pull additional datasets to understand the state's food insecurity ranking versus the other US states.

**Data Flaw 2:-** *In the FDA dataset, a single state has been marked with the same food insecurity rating regardless of city or geolocation; currently, averaging food insecurity rates is redundant.

```{r warning=FALSE}
# Group Houshold Food Insecurity by State
byState_FOODINSEC_15_17 <- All_Raw %>% group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(avg_FOODINSEC = mean(FOODINSEC_15_17, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_FOODINSEC)) %>%
  filter(!(is.na(avg_FOODINSEC))) # was Warning about 1 removd NAn row

# State abbreviations into full form 
MAP_statesearch <- data.frame(ShortState = state.abb, FullState = tolower(state.name))
MAP_FOODINSEC_15_17 <- byState_FOODINSEC_15_17 %>%
  left_join(MAP_statesearch, by = c("State" = "ShortState")) 

# Pull longlat coordinates for states with map_data() fx
MAP_longlat <- left_join( map_data("state") , MAP_FOODINSEC_15_17, by = c("region" = "FullState"))

  # plot Food insecurity US map
ggplot(MAP_longlat, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = avg_FOODINSEC)) +
  
  # draw borders
  geom_polygon(color = "white", size = 0.2) + 
  
  # fill in gradient of food insecurity
  scale_fill_gradient(na.value = "grey",low = "gold", high = "red") + 
  
  # erase background coordinate plane
  theme_void() +
  
  labs(title = "Food Insecurity Rate, 2015 to 2017", 
       fill = "Food Insecurity (%)")+
  
  theme(legend.position = "right", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))
```

## Focused Examination: New York State

Let's focus on implementing a Food Bank + Mobile Food Bank program in New York State, one of the most food insecure states. Within NY state, I identified the geolocations that have the **best access** to potential food donors—- meaning, communities that have the top 75% access to Grocery stores OR top 75% access to convenience stores and farmers markets. Grocery stores alone can work as a significant contribute to Food Banks as many large grocery chains have existing food donation programs. However, a combination of donations from convenience stores and farmers markets can also provide considerable supply to Food Banks. Placing food banks closest to the potential Donors are most likely encourage surplus food donations.

I use K means clustering to find 3 (can increase this value based on funding) of these **best access** clusters. These are the optimal sites for food banks. However, I arbitrarily selected "3" to be the number of food banks in NY; I suggest placing equal number of food banks between NY, MN, and LA, given that these are the most food insecure states, and decrease (if limited by funding) the number of food banks built based on each State's Food Insecurity rank. 

**Data Flaw:-** Food insecurity is marked the same across an entire state in FDA food atlas; NY, regardless of city, has a food insecurity rating of 17.9. It may be useful to pull additional datasets to understand a city- by- city or— ideally— household- by household status of food insecurity so that the red dots are more meaningful. I have included code to filtering the top most food insecure Geolocations once data for that is available.

**Data Flaw 2:-** It would also be useful to have the locations of potential Food Donors across the state; currently I am only assuming communities with high % access to Grocery and Convenience stores and Farmers markets are nearest to stores. I have included code to mark these locations with blue dots once that data is accessible.

```{r}
# NY state, the most food-insecure state
NY_All <- All_Raw %>% filter(StateAbbr == "NY")

# Potential Food Donors-----------
# Golocations with the best access to potential food donors Groceries, Convenience stores, Farmers market
      # Lets define best access as TOP 75%
NY_TopPotentialDonors <- NY_All %>%
  summarise(across(c(GROCPTH16, CONVSPTH16, FMRKTPTH18), ~ quantile(.x, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE))) 

# Filter for those census tract centroid that have the *best access* to donors
NY_FoodDonors <- NY_All %>%
  filter(GROCPTH16 >= NY_TopPotentialDonors$GROCPTH16 | 
         CONVSPTH16 >= NY_TopPotentialDonors$CONVSPTH16 & # combo of conv and farmers markets 
         FMRKTPTH18 >= NY_TopPotentialDonors$FMRKTPTH18) %>%
  select(Latitude, Longitude, GROCPTH16, CONVSPTH16, FMRKTPTH18)



# Food Insecure locations ---------- 
# TOP 90% most food insecure
NY_TopFoodInsecure <- NY_All %>%
  summarise(FoodInsec_Threshold = quantile(FOODINSEC_15_17, 0.90, na.rm=TRUE))
NY_FoodInsecure <- NY_All %>%
  filter(FOODINSEC_15_17 >= NY_TopFoodInsecure$FoodInsec_Threshold) %>%
  select(Latitude, Longitude, FOODINSEC_15_17)

   #summary(NY_kmeansClusters)

#   Cluster labels
NY_FoodDonors <- NY_FoodDonors %>%
  mutate(Food_Bank = as.factor(NY_kmeansClusters$cluster)) # 1, 2, 3

NY_BankLocations <- as.data.frame(NY_kmeansClusters$centers)

  # Draw food-insecure communities in red
  geom_point(data = NY_FoodInsecure, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),
             color = "orangered", size = 1, alpha = 0.2) +

  # Star Food Bank
  geom_point(data = NY_BankLocations, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude), 
             color = "black", shape = 8, size = 5) +  # Star shape for hubs

## Assessing Engagement
Individuals who value personal well being by staying up to date on routine healthcare—- doctor’s visits, dental checkups, and essential vaccinations—- are more likely to engage with these initiatives.Also, word- of- mouth referrals are an effective way to increase participation in localized programs; communities who have established faith in their healthcare providers may also learn about Food Access programs from their providers. Hence, I am incorporating doctors + dental visits, and essential- vaccine- completions as markers of potential engagement.

For each state, it is appears that of the population that is food insecure, roughly half may be engaged with the program given the assumption that food insecure individuals who are engaged in healthful living are likely to engage in community food programs.

**Data Flaw:-** It may be useful to bring in data on community hubs; understanding the prevalence of churches, community centers, etc., as well as percentage of the community that is involved with these hubs can provide more accurate insights into the estimate of people engaged in the Food Access program.

```{r}
# Estimate engagement with percent of individuals who have demonstrated engagement with healthcare checkups
All_Raw <- All_Raw %>%
  mutate(
    # # of the population that is Food Insecure
    FoodInsecCount = (FOODINSEC_15_17 / 100) * Population2010,
    # Engaged in healthful living -> engaged in community food programs
    Health_Engagement = (CHECKUP_CrudePrev + DENTAL_CrudePrev + COREW_CrudePrev + COREM_CrudePrev) / 4,
    # Food insecure population engaged
    FoodInsec_Engaged = (FoodInsecCount * Health_Engagement) / 100
  )

#  
Table_All_Engaged <- All_Raw %>%
  group_by(StateAbbr) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_Pop = sum(Population2010),
    FoodInsecCount = sum(FoodInsecCount, na.rm = TRUE),
    # average amount of people engaged in healthful living
    Avg_Health_Engagement = mean(Health_Engagement, na.rm = TRUE),
    FoodInsec_Engaged = sum(FoodInsec_Engaged, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%arrange(desc(FoodInsec_Engaged))

kable(Table_All_Engaged, caption = "Estimated Engagement in Food Access Program")

# Overlapping Bar Chart 
ggplot(Table_All_Engaged, aes(x= reorder(StateAbbr, FoodInsec_Engaged))) +
  
  geom_bar(aes(y= FoodInsecCount), stat = "identity",fill= "gray80", show.legend = TRUE) +
  
  geom_bar(aes(y= FoodInsec_Engaged), stat = "identity",fill= "cadetblue", show.legend = TRUE) +
  
  coord_flip() +
  
  labs(title = "Estimated Engagement in Food Access Program", x = "State", y = "Population", fill = "Legend") +
  
  theme_gray(base_size = 7) 

```


# Further Investigation

In addition to the **Data Flaws** I outlined, where I suggested additional datasets we can pull to fine tune these outcomes, there are few extending areas that can help us determine where and how to deploy this food access program. 

## Beneficiary subgroup and projected impact
Food insecurity rate was consistent throughout a single state; To truly understand which communities or cities *within* a state my benefit most, I would use variables like income level, employment status, and access to transportation to build logistic regression models to predict the the likelihood of a census tracked Centroid to experience food insecurity. 
To understand the long- term impact upon these households, we would measure the increase in food availability per household. Given that the FDA dataset provides data on the SNAP program, we can examine how the percent change in SNAP authorized stores correlates with the change in obesity, diabetes, cholesterol rates. 
SNAP incentivizes consumers to purchase healthier foods with coupons, discounts, and gift cards ([SNAP Healthy Incentives](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/healthy-incentives#:~:text=A%20key%20barrier%20to%20healthy,related%20chronic%20diseases%20and%20disparities.)). My proposed intervention encourages donations of healthy, surplus produce (hence the inclusion of farmers markets and dicussion of cosmetically imperfect foods). Therefore, we can use SNAP's impact to understand whether an increase in access to donated fresh produce has a complementary effect on the health outcomes.

## Estimate engagement of potential Food Donors

Even if we identify donor- dense areas, its not guaranteed that every donor will contribute equally. Variables such as past donations data, or logistical constraints like the capacity to store and transport food to Food Banks can be used to build linear regression models to estimate donor engagement.

## Optimization models for Mobile Food Bank Routes
The efficiency of the mobile food bank network will determine how much impact it can have. Given constraints such as funding, storage- time limits (perishable vs non- perishable foods), capacity of vehicles, road routes, etc., we can use an Linear programming to, say, minimize delivery cost or maxmimize pounds of food delivered.
